## Description

  This repository was created in order to store, monitor and showcase my learning process, while taking the "Introduction to Robotics" Course from FMI UniBuc.

## Homeworks

### 1. Homework 0
  Installed Arduino IDE and created this repository for monitoring and storing all the files related to the course (Code, Images, Homeworks etc.)
  
### 2. Homework 1
  I've made a controllable RGB led using 3 potentiometers and some written in the Arduino IDE. I get the signal from each of the potentiometers. The signals are in range 0-1023, and the led accepts a range 0-255. Using the map() function, I've mapped all the signals individually to the correct 0-255 range and fed them to the RGB led through each respective pins.
